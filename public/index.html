        Our game simulates the process of running a company and choosing what type of energy resources to use: Fossil
        Fuel, Wind, and Solar. This is a collaborative game where a lot of the players work together to sustain the CO2
        ppm below 600. The more power a company uses, the more revenue it generates and the more CO2 emission it
        produces. Your goal is to stay in the normal range, which is between 350 and 450 ppm. If ppm goes over 600 or
        you run out of capital, the game is over! Choose your energy wisely!

        Today's economy was built with the help of fossil fuels as its primary energy source and our economy depended on
        them for decades. However, it is one of the biggest problems that the earth is facing today. Due to the CO2
        emission of fossil fuel, the level of CO2 on earth is getting higher and higher causing abnormal environmental
        behavior such as climate change. Climate change leads to sea level rise, desertification, and unpredictable
        weather events. We want to raise awareness that renewable energy generating methods can save the earth.
